            1 2 FIN 4 RA FIN 7 8 FIN RA 11 FIN 13 14 FINRA 16 17 FIN


8. Create a python file named grade calculator, and Write a program for grade calculator:
    8.1. Ask the user "Enter your score"
            If user enters invalid score, terminate the program after displaying the error message "Invalid Entry"

    8.2 Display the grade of the student.
                    90 ~ 100 ==> A
                    80 ~ 89 ==> B
                    70 ~ 79 ==> C
                    60 ~ 69 ==> D
                    0 ~ 59 ==> F

    8.3 Ask the user would you like to continue

            If user enters an invalid entry, ask the user to re-enter until user provides a valid entry



9. Create a python file named custom_class_practices:
        9.1 Create a custom class named Pizza:

            calcCost(): returns the totalCost of the pizza
            __str__():returns a String containing the pizza size, quantity of each topping, and the pizza cost as calculated by calcCost()

        Pizza cost is determined by:
                        S: $10 + $2 per topping
                        M: $12 + $2 per topping

                Add a constructor that can set All the fields (instances)
                    
                Actions:
                    calcArea(): returns the area of Circle

                    calcPerimeter(): returns the perimeter of Circle

                    __str__(): displays the radius, diameter, pi, area and perimeter of the circle when the object of circle is passed in the print statemen
    


10. Create a python file named tuples_practices:
        10.1 Write a program that can display the palindrome strings from a tuple of string

                Ex:
                    words = ('Java', 'Anna', 'python', 'Cydeo', 'Level')

                    output:
                        Anna
                        Level


        10.2 Write a program that can display the common elements of two lists:

                Ex:
                    tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5)
                    tuple2 = (4,5,6,7,8)

                    Output:

                        5


        10.3 Write a program that can count the even and odd number from a tuple of integers
                
                Ex:
                    numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

                    Output:
                        There are 3 even numbers and 4 odd numbers
