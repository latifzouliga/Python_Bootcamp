4. Create a python file named Square, write a program that can calculate the area & perimeter of any given square

        Hint: side need to be given to calculate the area and perimeter of square
            Ex:
                Given Data:
                    side = 5

                output:
                    Area of the square is equal to 25
                    Perimeter of square is equal to 20
"""

side = 5
area = side * side
parameter = side * 4

print(f'Area of the square is equal to {area}')
print(f'Parameter of square is equal to {parameter}')
