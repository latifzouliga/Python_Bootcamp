5. Create a python file named Rectangle, write a program that can calculate the area & perimeter of any given Rectangle

        Hint: width and length need to be given to calculate the area and perimeter of rectangle
            Ex:
                Given Data:
                    length = 5
                    width = 2

                output:
                    Area of the rectangle is equal to 10
                    Perimeter of rectangle is equal to 20
"""

length = 5
width = 2
area = length * width
parameter = 2 * (length + width)
print(f'Area of the rectangle is equal to {area}')
print(f'Perimeter of rectangle is equal to {parameter}')
