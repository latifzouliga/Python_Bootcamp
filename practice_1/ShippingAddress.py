3. Create a python file named ShippingAddress. Declare the following variables:
                    name
                    building_number
                    street_name
                    city
                    state
                    zip_code

        Ex:
            Given data:
                name = "Aaron Kissinger"
                building_number = 13621A
                street_name = "Legacy Circle"
                city = "Fairfax"
                state = "VA"
                zip_code = 22030

            Output:
                Your shipping addrees is:
                        Aaron Kissinger
                        13621A Legacy Circle
